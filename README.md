# dotbarcode
C# barcode base library for .Net Core.

This library contains utility classes and interfaces releated barcode reading and scanning.
It was originally created as part of the shared libraries for the UWP apps I was building for Windows 10,
and I am now in the process of open-sourcing some of them
in the hope that they might be useful for other UWP app developers.

Nuget package available on [Nuget Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotCore.Barcode/):

    Install-Package DotCore.Barcode


_Note: This is for C# only, and it is not a cross-language Universal Windows Component library._
